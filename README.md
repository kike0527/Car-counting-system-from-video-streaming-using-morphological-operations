# Car-counting-system-from-video-streaming-using-morphological-operations

This is a basic introduction for moving object detection over a video streaming. We detect contours (cars) by computing diference between two frames (images) from the incoming video and keep track of such objects, also known as Blobs.

Once those blobs are detected, we increase a counter when a line (customly drawn on the video) is met by the blob.

Top run the program simply open the jupyter notebook file and execute it.
